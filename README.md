# Regex Practice in Javascript!

If you happen to have some cool examples of Regex tutorials or things you've had to do with Regexs please make a pull request and add on to this! Any additions would be greatly appreciated as I know I would like to get better with regexs and I know many others would as well!

## Options for adding on to this:

1. If you are just using a string variable and not reading from a file - Submit a javascript file with your github username + index.js . (ex. httpnickindex.js)

2. Submit a javascript file (as mentioned in step 1) and a file to read from (.txt, .ini, etc). Name this file with your github username + read.[somefileextension] . (ex. httpnickread.ini)
